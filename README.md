# Python Multi-Client Chat Application

## Overview
This project is a simple real-time chat application built using Pythonâ€™s socket and threading modules. It allows multiple clients to connect to a server and exchange messages concurrently. The server broadcasts messages to all connected clients, enabling group chat functionality.

## Features
- Multi-client support with concurrent handling via threading
- Nickname-based identification of users
- Graceful handling of client connections and disconnections
- Commands supported:
  - `/quit` â€” disconnect from the chat

## Getting Started
